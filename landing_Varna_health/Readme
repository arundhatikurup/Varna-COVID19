Varna Health is a comprehensive system that monitors one of the key indicators of COVID: elevated body temperature. The platform:

1.Collects health data from thermal camera selfie stations and biosensors
2.Enables healthcare workers to passively track their temperature and other symptoms on an app
3.Allows administrators effectively track team health and proactively manage staff risk with an all-in one web dashboard
Our secret sauce consists three areas:
IP on optimizing thermal reads from a lower grade thermal scan with cloud based storage of temperature reds to client accounts
First mover advantage in the US with partnership with patented EU manufacture wearable
AI built from input data in order to eventually predict COVID vs non COVID fevers
